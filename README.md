# subway-app

An Android application that maps the London Subway system, tracking the trains and their respective schedules all throughout tubes in the city.

This is an implementation of a class project for an intermediate programming course. Parts of the implementation include testing and implementing Java classes for the model of the application, such as tube lines, stations, arrival boards and arrival estimates. Project implementation also included arranging graphical markings on the map for the lines, stations, and zoom functions.
